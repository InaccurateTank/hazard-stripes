# hazard-stripes

Hazard Stripes is a mod that adds variations of Hazard Concrete.  These variations are meant to represent different warning situations.  Technically all versions are OSHA compliant but, lets face it, who cares.

- Operations Concrete: Black/White, non-urgent warnings.
- Emergency Concrete: Red/White, emergency purpose clearings.
- Safety Concrete: Green/White, evacuation routes.
- Radiation Concrete: Yellow/Purple, nuclear hazards.
